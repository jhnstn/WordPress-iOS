- We've made it easier to see when there are new blocks available for use on your site
- You can now highlight text using the "mark" HTML tag, as well as change the text and background colour of the Search block button. Shiny!
- We've hidden HTML tags in post titles when you're checking out your stats.
- We've improved Reader Discovery – showing you new things to read, while lending a helping hand to sites with low traffic. Win win.
- If you're part of a comment thread, you can keep track of it through in-app notifications, not just your email inbox.
- Speaking of comments, we heard that some might be missing when viewing comments from the Reader. Don't worry – we found and fixed the problem.
- The Help screen used to break out of its box when rotated from portrait to landscape and back to portrait, but now it's staying put.
- We fixed more cases where embed blocks would show "unable to display content", allowing you to see all of your content.
